  "description": "Modified by ShaggyDog. This Arduino library is improving the usage of a singe button for input. It allows using a digital input pin with a single pushbutton attached and detecting some of the typical button press events like single clicks, double clicks, multple clicks and long-time pressing. This enables you to reuse the same button for multiple functions and lowers the hardware investments.",
