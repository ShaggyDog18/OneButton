Arduino OneButton Library
===

This Arduino libary is improving the usage of a singe button for input.
It shows how to use an digital input pin with a single pushbutton attached
for detecting some of the typical button press events like single clicks, double clicks and long-time pressing.
This enables you to reuse the same button for multiple functions and lowers the hardware invests.

This is also a sample for implementing simple finite-state machines by using the simple pattern above.

// - modified state machine (still same number of states), maintained full compatibility with the initial library;
// - introduced a new functions: trippleClickFunc() for multiple 3+ clicks; getNumberClicks() to return number of clicks;
// - optomized - changed some types of variables (f.e.: bool _buttonPressed, uint8_t _state) to compact the code; 
// - optimized - by using switch() instead of multiple if()-s; 
// - introdiced #define PARAM_FUNC - if commented in oneButton.h , call functions with parameters will not be used to save space;
// - modified SimpleOneButton example to test more functions incl. new trippleClickFunc() and getNumberClicks() functions.
